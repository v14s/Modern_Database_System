mysql> select * from sale;

mysql> select Rownum as 'rank', Name, Region, Sales from (select Rownum, Name, region, sum(Sales) as Sales from sale group by Name, Region order by sum(Sales) DESC) as sale_record where Rownum <= 10;


MySQL Rank() Query :

If we partition by name as well as region then query be like  :

mysql> select Rownum, Name, Region, Sales, rank() over (partition by Name, Region order by Sales desc) as 'rank' from sale;



If we partition by region then ranking be like :

mysql> select Rownum, Name, Region, Sales, rank() over (partition by Region order by Sales desc) as 'rank' from sale;
